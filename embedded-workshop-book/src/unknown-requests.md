# Dealing with unknown requests: Stalling the endpoint

You may come across host requests other than the ones listed in previous sections.

For this situation, the USB specification defines a device-side procedure for "stalling an endpoint", which amounts to the device telling the host that it doesn't support some request.
> This procedure should be used to deal with invalid requests, requests whose SETUP stage doesn't match any USB 2.0 standard request, and requests not supported by the deviceâ€“ for instance the SET_DESCRIPTOR request is not mandatory.

You can use the `dk::usbd::ep0stall()` helper function to stall endpoint 0.
Your task is to do this in the right place in `usb-4.rs`.

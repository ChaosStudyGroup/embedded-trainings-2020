# References and Resources

## Beginner Material

- [nRF52840 Product Specification 1.1](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF52840_PS_v1.1.pdf)
- The [Embedded Rust Book][embedded rust] is a great learning resource, especially the Concurrency chapter.
- If you are looking to write an interrupt handler, look at the [`#[interrupt]` attribute][interrupt]. All interrupts implemented by the nrf52840 hal are listed in [`nrf52840-pac/src/lib.rs`][pac].  
It is also recommended that you work through the advanced material of this course to learn about [RTIC][rtic].
